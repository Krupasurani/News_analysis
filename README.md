# News Analysis Application

## Overview

The **News Analysis Application** is a Flask web app that allows users to search for news articles based on specific queries and date ranges. The application integrates with the News API to fetch articles and utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model for advanced processing, including summarization, key point extraction, sentiment analysis, and topic classification.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search for news articles by keyword and date range.
- **Article Summarization**: Summarize articles using the GPT-4 model.
- **Key Point Extraction**: Extract main points from articles.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment of articles (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Topic Classification**: Classify articles into various topics.
- **Pagination Support**: Navigate through multiple batches of articles.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **APIs**:
  - OpenAI API for natural language processing.
  - NewsAPI for fetching news articles.
- **Front-End Technologies**: HTML, CSS

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python and web development.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-analysis-app.git


Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username.

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change your current working directory to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd news-analysis-app
Step 3: Install Required Packages
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask requests openai newsapi-python
Step 4: Set Up API Keys
OpenAI API Key: Sign up at OpenAI and generate an API key.

News API Key: Sign up at News API to obtain your API key.

Open the main application file (e.g., app.py) and replace the placeholders with your actual API keys:

python
Copy code
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
NEWS_API_KEY = "your_news_api_key"
Step 5: Run the Application
Start the Flask application by running:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Step 6: Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the application.

Usage Instructions
Search for Articles:

Enter your search query in the designated input field.
Specify the date range using the "from" and "to" date pickers.
Click the "Search" button.
View Results:

The application will display a list of articles matching your criteria.
Each article will include its title, publication date, summarized content, key points, sentiment analysis, topic classification, and a link to the original source.
Pagination:

If there are more articles available, click the "Next Batch" button to fetch and view additional articles.
Code Explanation
The application consists of the following components:

1. Imports
Essential libraries and modules are imported to handle various functionalities:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, session
import os
import requests
import openai
import re
from typing import List, Dict
from newsapi import NewsApiClient
2. API Key Configuration
API keys are set up to authenticate requests to the OpenAI and News API services:

python
Copy code
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"  # Replace with your actual key
NEWS_API_KEY = "your_news_api_key"  # Replace with your actual key
3. Initialize News API Client and Flask App
The News API client is initialized, and the Flask application is created:

python
Copy code
newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key=NEWS_API_KEY)
app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'  # Required for session management
4. Constants
Define constants for batch size, which determines how many articles to fetch at a time:

python
Copy code
BATCH_SIZE = 5  # Number of articles to fetch each time
5. Data Collection
Fetching Articles: The fetch_news_articles function retrieves articles from the News API based on user-defined parameters:

python
Copy code
def fetch_news_articles(query: str, from_date: str, to_date: str, page: int) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation to fetch articles from News API
6. Article Processing
Text Cleaning: The clean_text function removes HTML tags and special characters from article content:

python
Copy code
def clean_text(text: str) -> str:
    # Implementation to clean article content
Preprocessing Articles: The preprocess_articles function processes each article for further analysis:

python
Copy code
def preprocess_articles(articles: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation to preprocess articles
7. LLM Integration
This section contains functions that interact with the OpenAI API to perform various analyses on the articles:

Summarization: The summarize_article function generates a summary for the article content.
Key Points Extraction: The extract_key_points function extracts key points from the article.
Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment_analysis function determines the sentiment of the article.
Topic Classification: The classify_topic function classifies the article's topic.
Each of these functions utilizes the get_llm_analysis helper function to communicate with the GPT-4 model.

8. Flask Routes
Main Route: The main route (/) handles GET and POST requests for searching articles:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    # Implementation to handle user requests and display results
Next Batch Route: The /next_batch route fetches additional articles if available:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/next_batch', methods=['POST'])
def next_batch():
    # Implementation to fetch next batch of articles
9. Batch Processing
The process_batch function consolidates all the analyses for each article and prepares the results for rendering:

python
Copy code
def process_batch(processed_articles) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation to process each article and generate results
10. Running the Application
Finally, the application runs in debug mode, enabling easy troubleshooting during development:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
